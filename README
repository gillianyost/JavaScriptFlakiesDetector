JavaScriptFlakies Detector: Flaky Test Detector using Jest for JavaScript Projects
UT Austin Master's Report by Gillian Yost based off of research project ut-flaky-test-project with Rifat Seleoglu

Dependencies:
Docker

Designed to be run in linux environment, will also run using WSL. Project tests will be run in a linux environment

To Run:
./launchDocker.sh FILENAME NUMBER_OF_RUNS [--stress or --no_stress]

Ex: ./launchDocker.sh ./SubjectFiles/oneTest.csv 1 --no_stress

Please allow ample disk space as the Docker Image is 1 GB as well as running on the stress option runs stress-ng which will stress your computer

The file Name is a csv file with the following information: github name, github link, commit number, date of commit, test command, 1 if jest is 24.7 or later 0 if earlier. Each line is a single JavaScript project. The JavaScript project must use npm and have an updated package.json file as it auto downloads all dependencies.
